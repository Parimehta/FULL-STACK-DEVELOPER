The user interface for the Job Tracker's "Applied Jobs" section is designed with clarity, responsiveness, and usability in mind. Each job application is displayed in a visually appealing card or list format, showing key details like the company name, role, and applied date. To enhance user experience, jobs are dynamically sorted by the most recent appliedDate at the top, allowing users to quickly track their latest applications. A clean, minimal layout is paired with intuitive date labels, visual hierarchy, and subtle hover effects to improve readability and engagement. Additionally, the interface adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring a consistent experience across devices. Interactive elements like search, filter by company/role/status, and color-coded application stages (e.g., applied, interviewing, offered) further elevate usability, making the job tracking process efficient and user-centric.
