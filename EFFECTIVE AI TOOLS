To optimize productivity and maintain code quality, several AI tools were leveraged during the development of the Job Tracker project. ChatGPT was instrumental in generating boilerplate code, solving logic-based problems like sorting and filtering job data, and providing clean, maintainable code snippets in both frontend and backend. GitHub Copilot enhanced the coding experience by offering intelligent autocomplete suggestions and contextual code generation directly in the editor, significantly speeding up routine tasks. For design inspiration and consistency, Uizard and Figma AI plugins were used to prototype UI components with a professional look and feel. Additionally, Notion AI aided in organizing development documentation, brainstorming features, and drafting explanations for walkthrough videos. The thoughtful integration of these tools ensured faster iteration, reduced cognitive load, and higher code and UI quality—all while aligning with the project’s professional standards.
